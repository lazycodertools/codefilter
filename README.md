Code Filter is a productivity tool that helps search and analyze source code. 

It allows to select (or hide) subsets of code based on syntax elements. 

Main use cases: 

* **Full-text search**

Reduce the amount of irrelevant results by defining a scope in terms of syntax elements. [Watch a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npL6sspoJ5g?rel=0).

* **High-level analysis**. 

Concentrate on high-level code elements and hide implementation details. 

* **Code maintenance**

Group similar code elements together for quick comparison.
